# Getting Started with HHG-CASESTUDY

Create a React application to implement these features:

1. A page which has a counter with 2 buttons:
   - To increase the counter +1 on click
   - To reset the counter to 0
2. A page which displays this table and has the “+ New” button as well:
   - Pull and push data from (to) a mock api source (https://www.mockapi.io/)
   - Pagination for every 5 items (per table page).

### `npm install`
